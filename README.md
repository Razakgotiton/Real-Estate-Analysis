# Real-Estate-Analysis
This project involves analyzing a real estate dataset to identify potential investment opportunities in the market. The dataset contains information about various properties, including their housing status, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, land size, location details (city, state, and zip code), house size, previous sold date, and price.

The goal of this project is to leverage the dataset to gain insights into the real estate market and discover patterns or trends that indicate promising areas for investment. By examining factors such as housing status, location, property size, and price, we aim to identify areas with high investment potential and make informed decisions.

The project will be carried out in several steps. I explored the dataset to understand its structure and contents. Then, i analyzed location factors by examining the average prices in different cities to identify areas with higher investment potential. Additionally, i analyzed property size by considering the average house sizes based on the number of bedrooms. This will help  identify properties with desirable sizes for investment.

Furthermore, i analyzed the price data to understand the pricing dynamics in different locations and property sizes. By identifying areas where property prices have been consistently increasing or where there might be opportunities for value appreciation, we can pinpoint potential investment opportunities.

Throughout the project, i leveraged data analysis techniques, such as grouping, sorting, and calculating averages, to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. This project serves as a starting point for identifying potential investment opportunities.
